// Darwin Shield — the safety layer (ADR-155 §safety controls). The load-bearing
// security boundary. Darwin Shield is STRICTLY DEFENSIVE: it discovers and
// remediates weaknesses in owned/authorized code and emits patches, tests,
// advisories, and risk reports — never working exploits.
//
// Four independent, defense-in-depth gates, all CODE not comments:
//
//   assertScope()        — a scan may only run against an owned/authorized repo.
//   redactUnsafeOutput() — strips/flags weaponized content from any string that
//                          would leave the sandbox (evidence, patch, advisory).
//   gateFinding()        — a Finding is admissible only if it carries no exploit
//                          payload and `exploitCodeAllowed` is false.
//   gateOutputs()        — batch gate over a run's findings; returns the safe set
//                          plus the count of rejected unsafe outputs (MUST be 0
//                          for a run to pass acceptance, ADR-155).
//
// This mirrors the kernel safety gate (`../safety.ts`, ADR-071) but operates on
// OUTPUT content (what we emit) rather than mutation-surface source (what we run).
/**
 * Content patterns that mark a string as a weaponized/offensive payload. If any
 * matches, the output is unsafe: it is redacted before emission and the run's
 * unsafe-output counter increments (a −1.00 fitness term — immediate rejection).
 *
 * Intentionally broad. A defensive finding describes WHERE a weakness is and HOW
 * to fix it; it never ships a runnable exploit, reverse shell, dropper, or
 * persistence/evasion mechanism.
