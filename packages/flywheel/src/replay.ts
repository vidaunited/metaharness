// @metaharness/flywheel — independent replay. Given ONLY a ReplayBundle (and, optionally, the pinned
// gate fingerprint + the gate rule itself), an external reviewer establishes the run with no trust in the
// producer:
//   (1) every promotion receipt verifies (Ed25519, recompute canon vs the embedded key);
//   (2) the promoted lineage reconstructs current → gen-0 immutable root, contiguously;
//   (3) every commit on the promoted chain is actually PROMOTED (no rejected node smuggled in);
//   (4) the gate fingerprint matches the pinned value ⇒ the promotion rule was UNCHANGED;
//   (5) [ADR-235, extended ADR-254] if the reviewer supplies the (fingerprint-matched) rule, every
//       PROMOTED commit is RE-GATED on its sealed baseline+candidate+anchor scores and must STILL
//       promote — trust the gate re-run, not the logged verdict. Catches a signed-but-forged promotion
//       the fingerprint check cannot. A PROMOTED commit with no (complete, well-typed) sealed scores to
//       re-gate FAILS this check, not passes by omission — including a root-pinned anchor bar with no
//       matching anchorScore on the commit.
//   (6) every entry in `all_commits` — the full diagnostic ledger of promoted AND rejected candidates —
//       also carries a receipt that verifies AND actually attests to that commit's own id + verdict, not
//       just the promoted `chain`. A signature is only as trustworthy as the fields it covers: `run.ts`
//       signs {kind, id, target, verdict, primaryDelta, ...sealed scores} (root: {kind, root}), so
//       `verifyReceipt` alone proves the PAYLOAD is internally consistent, not that it's attached to the
//       RIGHT commit — without cross-checking id/verdict, a REJECTED commit's outer `verdict` field could
//       be flipped to `PROMOTED` (or a receipt spliced onto a different id) and still "verify."
//   (7) whichever of id/target/verdict/primaryDelta/baselineScore/candidateScore/anchorScore/
//       failureReasons/parents/generation a commit's SIGNED receipt payload carries, the signed copy
//       must match the commit's live (unsigned) fields. Binding 'id' matters as much as the score
//       fields: without it, a bundle editor with no signing key can clone ONE genuine receipt across many
//       fabricated commit ids/parents (copying the real receipt's baseline/candidate/anchor scores onto
//       each fabricated commit too) to manufacture a fake multi-generation promoted lineage from a single
//       real promotion — (6)'s id/verdict cross-check alone would not catch this, since the cloned
//       receipt's sealed values still match the copied live fields. Binding 'parents'/'generation' closes
//       a DIFFERENT bypass of point (2): an editor can take TWO genuinely-signed, self-consistent commits
//       (each still correctly bound to its own id/scores) and splice them into a fabricated chain by
//       rewriting only their unsigned `parents`/`generation` — every per-commit check still passes, but
//       the reconstructed chain SHAPE was never actually signed by the producer. Checking whichever keys
//       a payload happens to carry keeps this additive: a receipt whose payload predates this check
//       (carries none of these keys) is left unchecked here — it does not retroactively secure old
//       bundles, only binds every bundle produced after this check shipped.
